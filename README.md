## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Solution URL: [Frontendmentor URL](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/social-proof-section-using-tailwind-css-YjQfKIUM6T)
- Live Site URL: [Netlify URL](https://social-proof-section-fe-mentor.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- TailwindCSS
- CSS3
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was another opportunity for me to hone my tailwind css skills. Though I am still more comfortable with SASS/SCSS or good ol' CSS, I am starting to get the hang of it.

### Continued development

It is possible to recreate this using React but for a newbie project, I am afraid it will be too much.
